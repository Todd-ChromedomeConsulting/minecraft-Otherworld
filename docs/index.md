## What is Otherworld?

Otherworld is a heavily customized Minecraft modpack that transforms the game into a D&D-inspired action RPG. It features:

- **Diablo-style loot** with 6 rarity tiers and 80+ random affixes (Apotheosis)
- **Distance-based mob scaling** that gets harder the further you explore (Autoleveling)
- **Action RPG combat** with combo chains, weapon animations, and hitboxes (Better Combat)
- **58+ bounty integrations** for quest-based gameplay (Extra Bounties)
- **Wave-based mob arenas** in 3 difficulty sizes (Gateways)
- **Temperature and thirst** survival mechanics (Legendary Survival)
- **Cross-mod compatibility** ensuring 392+ mods work together seamlessly

## How the Pack is Organized

All custom datapacks live in:

```
minecraft/config/paxi/datapacks/
```

**Paxi** is a mod that automatically loads datapacks from this folder — no need to manually install them into each world save. Any changes you make here apply to all worlds.

There are **7 custom Otherworld datapacks** (folders) and **14 additional datapacks** (zip files).

### Key Config Locations
