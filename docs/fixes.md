# Balance Patches

**Datapack:** `Otherworld_Fixes` (zipped)

Disables or rebalances specific items/features that were too powerful or caused issues.

## Changes Made

- **BetterNether Flaming Ruby gear** — Most recipes disabled (too easy to get powerful Nether gear)
- **BetterNether Ruby ore worldgen** — Modified (likely reduced spawn rate)
- **Backpack recipe** — Overridden (rebalanced)
- **EEEAB's Mobs Bloody Altar** — Biome restriction changed (controls where the structure spawns)
- **Valoria decorative pots** — Worldgen adjusted
